Image Classification Project
This project aims to classify images of dandelions and tulips using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset consists of images of dandelions and tulips sourced from KAGGLE.
The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of images of dandelions and tulips. The images are divided into two classes: dandelion and tulip. The dataset contains around 1000 images for each class.
The images are preprocessed and resized to a fixed size (e.g., 100x100 pixels) before being used for training the model.

Model Architecture:-
The convolutional neural network (CNN) model used for image classification consists of multiple layers including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers. The model architecture is as follows:

Input Layer: Accepts images of fixed size (e.g., 100x100 pixels) with 3 color channels (RGB).
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from input images using convolution operations.
Max-Pooling Layers: Downsample the feature maps to reduce spatial dimensions.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for classification.
The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (dandelion or tulip).

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate test set. The training process involves optimizing the model parameters using the Adam optimizer and minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss function.
The performance of the model is evaluated based on accuracy metrics.
